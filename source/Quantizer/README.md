# Quantizer

## Modes
There are two scale modes in this module. You can choose between flooring or ceiling when quantizing a note and within a specific range..

### Twelve note scale
Choose notes from an octive and the whole keyboard will be quantized to those twelve notes.


### 128 note scale
Instead of just an octave we can quantize to individual notes on the keyboard.

## Ideas
Rounding variations
- Normal
- Alternate
- Random

Chance on parameters.
What should happen if we try to quantize a note that's higher than our highest note and should we then quantize down?
Binary search quantizing?
